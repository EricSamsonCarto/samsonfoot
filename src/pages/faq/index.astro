          <span class="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900">What is direct care healthcare and how does it work?</span>
          <svg class="faq-arrow w-5 h-5 text-gray-500 transform transition-transform duration-200" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">

        <div class="faq-answer hidden px-6 pb-4 bg-white">
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Direct care healthcare is a practice model where patients pay directly for medical services without involving insurance companies. This eliminates the administrative overhead, pre-authorizations, and delays often associated with insurance-based care. You pay a transparent, upfront fee for your visit and treatments, allowing Dr. Samson to focus entirely on your care rather than insurance paperwork.</p>

      <!-- FAQ Item 2 -->
      <div class="faq-item bg-white">
        <button class="faq-question w-full text-left px-6 py-4 flex justify-between items-center hover:bg-gray-50 transition-colors duration-200 bg-white">
          <span class="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900">What are the benefits of choosing direct care over insurance-based care?</span>
          <svg class="faq-arrow w-5 h-5 text-gray-500 transform transition-transform duration-200" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">

          </svg>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer hidden px-6 pb-4 bg-white">
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Direct care offers several key advantages: transparent pricing with no surprise bills, faster appointment scheduling without waiting for insurance approvals, longer appointment times focused on your needs, direct communication with Dr. Samson, and often lower overall costs compared to insurance copays and deductibles. You also maintain complete control over your healthcare decisions without insurance company restrictions.</p>

      <!-- FAQ Item 3 -->
      <div class="faq-item bg-white">
        <button class="faq-question w-full text-left px-6 py-4 flex justify-between items-center hover:bg-gray-50 transition-colors duration-200 bg-white">
          <span class="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900">How much do direct care appointments and treatments cost?</span>

        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer hidden px-6 pb-4 bg-white">
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Our pricing is transparent and competitive. Many patients find that direct care costs are comparable to or less than their insurance copays and deductibles, especially when factoring in the convenience and quality of care. We provide detailed pricing information during your initial consultation so there are never any surprises.</p>

      <!-- FAQ Item 6 -->
      <div class="faq-item bg-white">
        <button class="faq-question w-full text-left px-6 py-4 flex justify-between items-center hover:bg-gray-50 transition-colors duration-200 bg-white">
          <span class="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900">Can I submit receipts to my insurance for reimbursement?</span>
          <svg class="faq-arrow w-5 h-5 text-gray-500 transform transition-transform duration-200" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">

        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer hidden px-6 pb-4 bg-white">
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Yes! Many insurance plans offer out-of-network benefits that can reimburse you for direct care services. We provide detailed receipts with all necessary medical codes and information that you can submit to your insurance company. While reimbursement rates vary by plan, many insurers reimburse 50-80% of out-of-network services once you've met your deductible. The process is simple: pay for your visit, receive our detailed receipt, submit it with your insurance company's out-of-network claim form, and receive reimbursement directly from your insurer. Be sure to check your specific plan's out-of-network benefits and filing deadlines. The exceptions are governmental insurance plans (Medicare, MaineCare, TriCare). These companies will not allow for reimbursement of office costs. Fortunately however, if hospital surgical procedures are needed, they are covered by the plans through direct billing by the hospital.</p>

        <button class="faq-question w-full text-left px-6 py-4 flex justify-between items-center hover:bg-gray-50 transition-colors duration-200 bg-white">
          <span class="text-lg font-medium text-gray-900">Can I still use my health insurance for other medical needs?</span>

        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer hidden px-6 pb-4 bg-white">
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Absolutely! Choosing direct care for your podiatric care doesn't affect your ability to use insurance for other healthcare needs. Many patients appreciate having the option to use direct care for routine foot and ankle care while maintaining their insurance for other medical services, emergencies, or specialist referrals outside our practice. We can also provide detailed receipts that you may be able to submit to your insurance for potential reimbursement.</p>
